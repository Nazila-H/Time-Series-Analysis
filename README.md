## Time Series Analysis
The idea is cleaning and analyzing mean-tempreture time series data for Berlin-Tempelhof then predicting the mean-tempreture of 01.01.2023 in Berlin.

### Steps:

Get and clean temperature data from www.ecad.eu<br/>
Build a baseline model for modelling trend and seasonality<br/>
Plot and inspect the different components of a time series<br/>
Model time dependence of the remainder using an AR model<br/>
Compare the statistical output of different AR models<br/>
#Test the remainder for stationarity
